-> Redux is also used for state management as we were doing using context api.
-> here there will be a global state where all the data of app will be kept.
-> here we deal with slices -> a portion of data from the global storage.

-> the centralized store will be made of slices.

store -> slices

-> while creating a slice we have to mention -> 1) the name of the slice
                                                2) initial state of the slice
                                                3) reducer for the slice

-> createSlice is a inbuilt function used to create a slice ek package install krna pdega.
